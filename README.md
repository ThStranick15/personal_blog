## Author: Thomas Stranick

## Description

This blog was created to showcase some javascript as well as DOM functionality. The main page acts as a form to submit a blog post to be displayed o the next page. This information is stored in local storage so that the webpage can access it whenever it needs. If there is no information inputted, then they will be asked to fill out the information. There is also a toggle to switch the page into light and dark mode, changing some css styling within the pages.

## Usage

To use the webpage, the user can use the form on the main page to input text and submit a blog post. The user will then be taken to the blog post page where they can see all blog posts submitted. The pages can be navigated using the button on the top left. There is also a toggle there to switch the styling from dark mode to light mode. On the footer there is also a link to my portfolio that was created previously.
